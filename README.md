# Bharath's Personal Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to **G. Bharath's Portfolio Website** – a modern and responsive web portfolio built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **PHP**. This project showcases a personal profile and includes a working contact/query form that demonstrates basic PHP form handling.

- 📄 Profile introduction with navbar navigation

- 📬 Contact/Query form with:
  - JavaScript validation
  - PHP backend processing
  - User-friendly messages after submission

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 📁 Project Structure


## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user fills out the **query form** on `Form.html`.
2. JavaScript performs client-side validation.
3. The form is submitted to the same page (self-processing form using PHP).
4. PHP captures the form data, sanitizes it, and displays a thank-you message.
